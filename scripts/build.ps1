.SYNOPSIS
  NORMAL BUILD (releases / playing): builds Tweaks in Release mode, installs it into the game's BepInEx\plugins folder and
  switches the BepInEx console window and log file OFF. Nothing else is written. For debugging use scripts\build-dev.ps1.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\build.ps1 -GameDir "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dice-Kingdoms"   # first time: remembers the path
  .\scripts\build.ps1                                                             # afterwards
  .\scripts\build.ps1 -Run                                                        # build, install and start the game

  If PowerShell refuses to run scripts:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build.ps1
